# 🚗 Parking System – Java Mini Project

This is a simple **console-based Parking Management System** developed in Java. It simulates a real-world parking lot where users can park and remove cars, check availability, and view parked vehicles. The project demonstrates basic Java concepts such as arrays, loops, user input handling, and object-oriented programming.

## 📌 Features

- 🅿️ Allows user-defined number of parking slots  
- 🚘 Park a car by entering its license plate  
- 🚪 Remove a parked car  
- 📋 View all currently parked cars  
- ⚠️ Prevents duplicate or over-capacity entries  
- 📉 Displays updated available slots in real-time  

---

## 🧠 Concepts Used

- Java Collections (`ArrayList`)
- Loops & Conditional Statements
- Static Methods & Variables
- Scanner Class for Input
- Console-based User Interaction

## 🗂️ File Structure

```
📁 ParkingSystem/
└── ParkingSystem.java     # Main Java file with core logic
```

---

## 🛠️ How to Run

1. Make sure you have **Java installed**.
2. Compile and run the program:

```bash
javac ParkingSystem.java
java ParkingSystem
```

3. Follow the on-screen options to interact with the system.

## 🧪 Sample Use Case

```
Enter the total number of parking slots:
5

What would you like to do?
1. Park a car
2. Remove a car
3. View parked cars
4. Exit
```

## ✅ Project Outcomes

- Demonstrated ability to build structured CLI-based systems.
- Strengthened core Java programming skills.
- Learned how to manage dynamic user data using `ArrayList`.

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Track parking time and calculate charges
- Assign specific slot numbers
- Add file-based storage for persistent records
- GUI-based interface using JavaFX or Swing
